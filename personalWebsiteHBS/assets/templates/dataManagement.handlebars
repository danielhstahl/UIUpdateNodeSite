The purpose of data is to deliver information to humans in an actionable form. This purpose implies data availability, data integrity, and data connectivity.  To help achieve this purpose, I have self-imposed the following criteria:<ul><li>Every data table that I create will have a primary key.  </li><li>In the nearly universal case that more than one table is required to maintain efficient and normalized data, every pertinent table will have at least one foreign key. </li></ul>
This purpose also precludes humans from ever altering, viewing, or touching data at any granular level.  Humans were not intended to accurately and efficiently process data.
