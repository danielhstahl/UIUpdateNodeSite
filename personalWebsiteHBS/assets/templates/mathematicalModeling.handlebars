The purpose of a model is to interpret data for human consumption to facilitate superior decision making.  Increasing complexity of the stochastic data generating process requires mathematical sophistication, while providing results in a timely, understandable, and applicable manner.  Thus a model must be computationally efficient, it must have informative output, and it must be reliable.  As with data, I have self-imposed the following constraints in creating a model:<ul><li> The model must be parsimonious</li><li> The model must, whenever practicable, have a semi-analytical solution (to the point that efficient methods of solutions can achieved)</li><li> The model must be repeatable.</li><li> The model either must be have a GUI or be embedded within a data flow. </li></ul>
