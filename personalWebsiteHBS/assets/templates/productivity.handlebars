  People are naturally creative thinkers.  Many mundane and repetitive tasks are delegated to humans in the corporate world.  These are the tasks at which computers are superior.  My passion is to realize productivity enhancements through the proper design of workflows so that the workload is optimally divided between man and machine.  A happy byproduct of such an optimization is a technically superior, critically engaged workforce.
