Audit Analytics provides data services to Audit Services to facilitate audit testing.  These data services involve creating visualizations to make the underlying data accessible and actionable to Audit Services, automating audit testing, and providing self-service tools for auditors to dynamically explore the data.  Audit provides a unique opportunity for analyzing data.  Audit's mandate is to independently access bank data sources in order to provide assurance around the bank's processes.  Hence all the bank's data is available for Audit Analytics to mine.  These data sources can be as diverse as system access data (for example, using active directory), portfolio data at the loan level, and transactional data for wires.
